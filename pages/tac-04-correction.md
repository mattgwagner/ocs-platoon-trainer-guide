# Corrective Training - Legal Framework

::left::

## **AR 600-20 Authority**

**Para 4-6b(1):** "Brief physical exercises are an acceptable form of corrective training for minor acts of indiscipline (for example, requiring the Soldier to do push-ups for arriving late to formation), so long as it does not violate the Army's policies prohibiting hazing, bullying, and unlawful punishment."

## Key Principles
- **Directly Related** to deficiency
- **Educational** in nature
- **Non-punitive** approach
- **Time-limited** duration
- **Proportional** to offense

::right::

## **Legal Boundaries**

**What It IS:**
- Training to correct deficiencies
- Educational reinforcement
- Performance improvement
- Standards maintenance

**What It's NOT:**
- Punishment
- Hazing or bullying
- Retaliation
- Excessive or oppressive
