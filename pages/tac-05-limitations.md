# Limitations of TAC Officers

- Should not execute evaluations based solely on personal opinions.
- Avoid favoritism or bias.
- Know when to escalate disciplinary actions.
- **Legal/Ethical Boundaries:** Never use corrective measures as punishment or hazing.
- **Self-Awareness:** Recognize personal biases and seek feedback from peers.
- **Escalation:** Refer serious or repeated issues to the chain of command or behavioral health as appropriate.
- **Note:** When in doubt, consult with senior TACs or legal advisors to ensure compliance with policy.

> **Scenario:** A candidate repeatedly violates standards despite counseling. The TAC Officer documents all actions and escalates the issue to the company commander, ensuring due process and transparency.
