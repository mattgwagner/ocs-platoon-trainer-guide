# Limitations of TAC Officers

- Do not execute evaluations based solely on personal opinions. See [Common Pitfalls & Solutions](./tac-15-common-pitfalls.md) for more on bias and fairness.
- Avoid favoritism or bias. Reference [Ethical Leadership](./tac-13-ethical-leadership.md) for guidance.
- Know when to escalate disciplinary actions. Refer serious or repeated issues to the chain of command or behavioral health as appropriate.
- Never use corrective measures as punishment or hazing. See [Legal Compliance](./tac-19-legal-compliance.md) for legal/ethical boundaries.
- When in doubt, consult with senior TACs or legal advisors to ensure compliance with policy.

> **Scenario:** A candidate repeatedly violates standards despite counseling. The TAC Officer documents all actions and escalates the issue to the company commander, ensuring due process and transparency.
