# Scenario-Based Training

- Use realistic scenarios to reinforce learning and decision-making.
- Rotate leadership roles to develop adaptability.
- Encourage candidates to plan, execute, and review missions.
- Provide immediate feedback and facilitate after-action reviews (AARs).
- Adapt scenarios to address observed weaknesses or training gaps.
- **Tip:** Always conduct a structured debrief to maximize learning from each scenario.

> **Scenario:** During a simulated patrol, the TAC Officer observes a breakdown in communication. After the exercise, the team conducts an AAR, identifying lessons learned and strategies for improvement.
