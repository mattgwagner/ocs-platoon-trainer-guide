# Ethical Leadership

- Uphold Army values in all actions and decisions.
- Recognize and address ethical dilemmas (e.g., favoritism, reporting misconduct).
- Use decision-making frameworks (e.g., Army Problem Solving Process, ethical triangle).
- Model transparency and accountability.
- Encourage candidates to speak up about ethical concerns.
- **Tip:** When faced with a dilemma, seek advice from mentors or legal advisors.

> **Scenario:** A candidate reports witnessing a peer violate safety protocols. The TAC Officer investigates, addresses the issue, and commends the candidate for integrity, reinforcing a culture of accountability.
