# Common Pitfalls & Solutions

- Inconsistent enforcement of standards
- Allowing personal biases to influence decisions
- Failing to document counseling or corrective actions (see [Counseling & Feedback](./tac-12-counseling-feedback.md))
- Neglecting self-care and professional development
- Overlooking the importance of team cohesion
- Not escalating serious or repeated issues appropriately (see [Limitations of TAC Officers](./tac-05-limitations.md))
- Using corrective measures as punishment or hazing (see [Legal Compliance](./tac-19-legal-compliance.md))
- Lack of follow-up after corrective actions
- Poor communication or unclear expectations

**Tip:** Regularly reflect on your actions and seek feedback to identify blind spots. When in doubt, consult with peers, senior TACs, or legal advisors.

> **Scenario:** A TAC Officer realizes they have been more lenient with certain candidates. After self-reflection and peer feedback, they adjust their approach to ensure fairness and consistency.
