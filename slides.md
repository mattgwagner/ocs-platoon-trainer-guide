# Proffer No Excuses

Never volunteer excuses or explain a shortcoming unless an explanation is required. The Army demands results. More damage than good is done by proffering unsought excuses.

# Applying Rigor and Productive Stress in Training

- **Purpose:** Develop resilience, adaptability, and effective decision-making under pressure.
- **Principle:** Stress should be applied in a controlled, professional, and non-abusive manner to enhance learning and performance.

**Productive Methods to Apply Rigor:**

- Impose limited time to complete tasks or missions
- Use controlled, professional yelling or loud commands to simulate confusion and urgency
- Introduce complex, ambiguous scenarios requiring rapid adaptation
- Require multitasking or simultaneous problem-solving

# More Methods for Productive Stress

- Rotate leadership roles unexpectedly
- Conduct peer or group evaluations under observation
- Vary environmental conditions (noise, light, distractions)
- Enforce strict adherence to standards with immediate feedback

> _All stress-inducing methods must remain within ethical and regulatory boundaries. The goal is to prepare candidates for real-world challenges, not to humiliate or break them._
