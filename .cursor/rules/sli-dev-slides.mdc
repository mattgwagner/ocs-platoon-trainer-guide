# Sli.dev Slides Rule

## Rule Description
This rule ensures that all Sli.dev slides created or edited in this project adhere to the official syntax and project structure as documented at [https://sli.dev/guide/syntax](https://sli.dev/guide/syntax). Slides must be concise and coherent.

## Rule Details
- **Category**: Content Quality & Consistency
- **Severity**: High
- **Scope**: All Sli.dev slide markdown files (e.g., `slides.md`)

## Requirements
1. **Reference Official Documentation**
   - All slide syntax and project structure decisions must be based on the official Sli.dev documentation: [https://sli.dev/guide/syntax](https://sli.dev/guide/syntax).
   - When in doubt about syntax or structure, consult the documentation.
2. **Conciseness**
   - Slides should communicate ideas clearly and succinctly.
   - Avoid unnecessary verbosity or overly long text blocks.
3. **Coherence**
   - Each slide should present a single, clear idea or topic.
   - The flow between slides should be logical and easy to follow.
4. **Formatting**
   - Use `---` to separate slides as per Sli.dev syntax.
   - Use frontmatter and per-slide frontmatter as described in the documentation.
   - Use Markdown and Sli.dev extensions (e.g., code blocks, notes, diagrams) appropriately.

## Validation
- Reviewers should check that all slides:
  - Follow the official syntax and structure
  - Are concise and coherent
  - Use formatting and features as described in the documentation
- Any deviation should be corrected by referencing the official guide.
